# Pricing Table for Deploying Private and Proprietary LLMs

## Private (On-Premise) LLM Deployment Costs
| Description                       | Cost                                 |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Hardware acquisition**          | $200,000 (NVIDIA A100 GPU setup)     |
| **Average price per GPU**         | $20,000(A100)                        |
| **Maintenance & energy**          | Varies (site-dependent)              |
| **Usage-based costs**             | N/A                                  |


## Proprietary (Cloud-Based) LLM Deployment Costs
| Description                        | Cost                                  |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Hardware acquisition**           | N/A                                   |
| **API usage (GPT-4) - Input Cost** | $30.00 per million tokens             |
| **API usage (GPT-4) - Output Cost**| $60.00 per million tokens             |
| **Server cost (AWS A100 server)**  | $5/hour          |



#### Notes:
- **Hardware Acquisition**: Private deployment requires significant upfront investment in hardware, such as high-performance GPUs. In contrast, cloud-based models eliminate this cost by leveraging the provider's infrastructure..
- **Recurring Operational Costs**: For on-premise deployment, ongoing costs include maintenance and energy, which can vary greatly. Cloud-based services generally include these costs, simplifying budgeting and operations.
- **Usage-Based Costs**: While private deployments do not typically incur direct usage-based fees (unless specific software or licensing fees are involved), cloud-based deployments include costs based on API usage and the computational resources consumed.
- **Server Infrastructure**: Private deployments require substantial investment in server infrastructure, whereas cloud services offer flexible and scalable server resources, charging only for what is used.
