You are asked to generate 10 diverse sets of instructions and outputs using PyBGPStream library.
Requirements:
1. Instructions should include Accessing live stream data sources.
2. Analysis task should address the following smaller subtasks: topological analysis, security analysis, time-series analysis, event correlation, AS relationship, path length or preference analysis, visualization, network configuration and reliability, community and policy analysis
3. Not all instructions require input. In that case, simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.
4. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input.
5. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction.
6. Adhere to the guidelines of PyBGPStream and utilize its parameters correctly in given examples.

Here is a complete example of the instruction and the output:
