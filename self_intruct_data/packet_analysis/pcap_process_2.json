One instruction should construct a Python script that processes a pcap file with Scapy, extracts authentication request details for 4G networks, and organizes them into a structured pandas DataFrame.\n2. Subsequent instructions should include but not limited to: analyzing authentication requests at theoo network level, analyzing protocol dynamics in 4G networks, packet timing scrutiny within 4G networks, and assessing authentication requests for 4G networks.\n3. Not all instructions require input. For example, when a instruction asks about some general information, \"write a python program to load a file.\", it is not necssary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put \"<noinput>\" in the input field.\n4. Each instruction should vary in its verbs and language structure to enhance diversity. Instructions can mix interrogative forms with commands.\n5. Instructions must follow Scapy's usage conventions and accurately employ its functions and features.\n\nHere is a complete example of the instruction and the output:",

You can modify each instruction to varied forms, as per each task's requirements. The output programs may also vary. It is important to follow Scapy's usage conventions. For instance, when specifying PCAP File parameters, as shown in the example, the correct way is to write 'pcap_file = \"filename.pcap\"' and not 'open(\"filename.pcap\")' as that won't accurately employ Scapy's functions. In addition, when performing calculations, it is recommended to use the statistics library for accuracy. Lastly, it is crucial to include error handling in all programs. In the above example, the try-catch block should be modified to meet this requirement. \nThese example instruction outputs can be modified and adapted to fit the specific requirements of an analysis task. As long as they accurately employ the relevant functions, features, and usage conventions of Scapy, and handle errors properly, these instructions and outputs should serve as a useful guide for 5G network pcap processing utilizing the Scapy library. \n\nHave fun coding and Happy researching !  :-) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n. \n\n \n\u00a7 END OF DOC\n# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # \n# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # \n# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # \nYou are tasked with generating pertinent packet details specific to 5G traffic from pcap files, utilizing Scapy.\nRequirements:\n1.
