You are tasked with generating unique sets of instructions and outputs for 5G network pcap processing utilizing the Scapy library.
Requirements:
1. One instruction should  construct a Python script that processes a pcap file with Scapy, extracts pertinent packet details specific to 5G traffic, and organizes them into a structured pandas DataFrame.
2. Subsequent tasks should be including but not limited to:5G protocol stacks, analysis of 5G traffic and protocol dynamics, packet timing scrutiny within 5G networks, and network performance assessments for 5G communications.
3. Not all instructions require input. For example, when a instruction asks about some general information, "write a python program to load a file.", it is not necssary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.
4. Each instruction should vary in its verbs and language structure to enhance diversity. Instructions can mix interrogative forms with commands.
5. Instructions must follow Scapy's usage conventions and accurately employ its functions and features.

Here is a complete example of the instruction and the output:
